## Why EduHub? (Core Strengths)

- **Offline-Resilient Student Experience**  
  Built with **Svelte 5** and client-side IndexedDB (**Dexie.js**), active quiz state is cached locally in real time. If a student experiences an unexpected network drop or page reload, their progress and answered questions are preserved. Pending submissions are automatically queued and synced when reconnected.

- **Exam Integrity & Anti-Cheating Alerts**  
  Monitors active tab and window focus during quizzes. If a student leaves the quiz tab or switches windows, violation events are logged and email notifications are automatically dispatched to the instructor.

- **Per-Question Countdown Timers**  
  Each question features its own dedicated countdown timer and strict client-server pacing, ensuring students cannot stall and exams progress smoothly.

- **Instructor Room & Schedule Management**  
  Every instructor has their own dedicated room and dashboard. Teachers can create questions with rich text and image attachments, set custom timers, schedule automated release times, or start and stop quizzes on demand.

- **Leaderboards, Analytics & PDF Export**  
  After quizzes conclude, instructors and students get instant score breakdowns, visual performance graphs powered by Chart.js, and downloadable PDF leaderboards for grading records.
